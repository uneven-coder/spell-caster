## SpellTemplate Modifier

The `SpellTemplate` class is a template for creating new spell modifiers. It extends `SpellModifier` and has full access to event systems, modifier references, and the spell caster context. It's meant to be copied and customized for new modifiers and includes documentation directly in the code.

This template shows how to use the event system (`OnCast`, `OnAction`, `OnEvent`) and how modifiers can react to each other within a spell chain. It also shows how to access key spell system functions.

### How It Works

#### Core Concepts

Spells and modifiers may be used interchangeably in this doc, use context to determine meaning. 

Prefilled variables (like strings, bools, ints) are examples and don't restrict valid input types.

A spell holds an array of spellModifiers, usually created beforehand and added to a `SpellCaster`.

When a spell is cast, all modifiers are executed in order, based on their event type and position. A modifier can subscribe to another’s `OnCast` or `OnAction`, which will trigger its own `OnEvent`. `OnEvent` does not propagate like a cast—only casts and actions can be subscribed to.

All of this happens within the modifier’s cast. Allowing for multiple modifiers to run with the OnCast of another this allows for setup of things like projectiles, colliders, or particle systems before other modifiers run.

DO NOT, manualy invoke `onCast`, `onAction` or other internaly handeled actions, these are handled by the base spell modifier.

#### Global Setup

##### [Importing Subscribed Modifiers as Objects](#importing-subscribed-modifiers-as-objects)

Useful when you know and want a modifier type. Inside a modifier, `_subscribedCastModifier` and `_subscribedActionModifier` can be used to access references. For example, use `_subscribedCastModifier` as a projectile reference. Type management is recommended.

---

##### References

Modifiers allow overriding reference behavior:

```csharp
public override bool UseReference => false;
```

This enables [OnEvent](#oneventspellcaster-caster-unityevent-spellevent-spelleventtype-eventtype) and UI integration.

---

###### [Listening and GUI](#listening-and-gui)

With `UseReference` enabled, the modifier UI shows dropdowns to set `OnCast` and `OnAction` references to other modifiers in the same spell.

Dropdowns list modifiers by position and file name, e.g. `3: destroy`.

Editor support may be limited for private fields or custom attributes. Basic types work.

You can customize or hide the reference dropdowns:

```csharp
public override string CastReferenceLabel => "My Cast Ref";
public override string ActionReferenceLabel => "My Action Ref";
public override bool ShowCastReferenceSelector => true;
public override bool ShowActionReferenceSelector => false;
```

---

### OnCast(SpellCaster caster)

Called when the spell is cast. Modifiers trigger in order of position.

You have access to the full `SpellCaster` context:

* `caster.spellSelections`
* `caster.CurrentSpell`
* `caster.caster`
* `caster.caster.player`

Example use:

```csharp
if (Random.Range(0, randomMax) <= randomMax / 2)
    OnAction(caster, onAction());
```

This triggers an `OnAction` from `OnCast` under a condition.

---

### OnAction(SpellCaster caster, Action action)

Used for effects that aren't part of casting directly—like delayed actions, collisions, or timers.

Unlike `OnCast`, `OnAction` is triggered only by the modifier, and allows other modifiers to respond.

To use it, define a private method that returns an `Action`, and pass it to `OnAction`.

```csharp
public override void Function(/*...*/)
{
    if (eventType == SpellEventType.OnAction && destroyOnEvent)
    {
        if (_gameObject != null)
            OnAction(caster, onAction(_gameObject));
    }
}

private new Action onAction(GameObject obj) => () =>
{
    if (obj != null)
        UnityEngine.Object.Destroy(obj);
};
```

---

### OnEvent(SpellCaster caster, UnityEvent spellEvent, SpellEventType eventType)

Only runs if `UseReference` is `true`. Lets the modifier listen for `OnCast` or `OnAction` events from a referenced modifier.

Useful for:

* Reacting to earlier modifiers
* Synced effects
* Event-based chaining

Event type is checked explicitly:

```csharp
if (eventType == SpellEventType.OnAction) { /* ... */ }
```
